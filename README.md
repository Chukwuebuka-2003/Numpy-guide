# Numpy-guide
A descriptive and interactive guide on how to use Numpy.

This guide is intended to help beginners learn the basics of using the Numpy Library for numerical computing in python.

It was built using Jupyter Notebook, an interactive web-based environment that allpws users to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.

In this guide, you will learn the following:

- What is Numpy and why is it important for scientific computing
- How to install Numpy on your local machine (pip install  numpy)
- How to create Numpy arrays and manipulate them using basic operations
- How to perform element-wise operations and matrix operations using Numpy
- How to use Numpy functions for statistical analysis and linear algebra
- How to plot Numpy arrays using Matplotlib


To use this guide, you can download the entire repository or clone it to your local machine. You can then open the Jupyter Notebook file using the Jupyter Notebook application or the JupyterLab interface. Alternatively, you can view the files online on GitHub or using the nbviewer service.

I hope you find this guide useful for learning Numpy and enhancing your skills in numerical computing.
